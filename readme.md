Steps to install and run:

Notes:
1. You need to add Google Geocode API key in Home.js
2. You need to add Google Maps API key in Appdelegate.m
3. Did not configure for android as I do not have Android studio installed [had to remove Android studio to make space for macos update].
4. Realised I was supposed to use Typescript after I finished the test, I thought about re-doing but it was already too late.
